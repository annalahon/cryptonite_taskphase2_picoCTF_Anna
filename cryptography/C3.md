# C3

**Flag:** picoCTF{adlibs}

**Description:** 
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!
Download the ciphertext here.
Download the encoder here.
Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}".

**Hints:**
Modern crypto schemes don't depend on the encoder to be secret, but this one does.

**Approach:** 
I opened the ciphertext which was just a bunch of capital and small letters. Then, i opened the encoder which was a python code. I made a decoding code for this which goes: 
```
import sys
chars = list("DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl")

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""
prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  num = (cur+prev) % 40
  out += lookup1[(cur+prev) % 40]
  prev = num
  
print(out)
```
Running this gave me a `python2` code which went like:
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
I put this in a file on the browser webshell and ran the ciphertext file which gave me the flag.

**Learnings:**
1. Learning about python2 code
2. Creating a decoding file
